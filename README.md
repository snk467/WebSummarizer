# WebSummarizer

WebSummarizer is a lightweight Python script that leverages the OpenAI API to generate website summaries. It utilizes Selenium to load web pages, enabling the processing of script-generated content. The solution is inspired by [llm_engineering](https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering) course by Ed Donner.
